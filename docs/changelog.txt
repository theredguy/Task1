===============
= version 1.2 =
===============
(*) Added 816 Path Traversal / Local File Inclusion test cases.
(*) Added 8 categories of false positive Path Traversal / Local File Inclusion test cases.
(*) Added 108 Remote File Inclusion test cases.
(*) Added 6 categories of false positive Remote File Inclusion test cases.
(*) Replicated 408 Path Traversal test cases to "active-form-action-version" directory,
    and altered them to include the action property in forms.
(*) Created a platform for easily implementing test cases for 4+ additional vulnerabilities
    (Open Redirect, Insecure Forward/File Enumeration, Code LFI, Code RFI, etc) - 
    will be implemented in future versions of wavsep (now implemented as false lfi/rfi test cases). 
(*) Fixed a few minor spelling issues.
(*) Updated the main index page and several other index pages.
(*) Added documentation on the admin/root permissions required to run wavsep 
    (the tomcat user should be granted permissions on the /db/ folder under tomcat/eclipse root,
     or root/admin privileges - recommended for better coverage of lfi/rfi test cases).  

=================
= version 1.1.1 =
=================
(*) Issue 2 - Changed the encoding of all jsp pages from "windows-1255" to "ISO-8859-1"
    (might cause an OS specific bug)
(*) Issue 4 - Changed the numbering convention of single digit cases from [digit] to [zero][digit]
    in order to make counting results easier (Case1->Case01...Case9->Case09).
(*) Moved all the active test cases into the "active" directory and changed various 
    index pages and references inside test cases accordingly.
(*) Removed unnecessary comments from various locations.

=================
= version 1.1.0 =
=================
(*) Using derby 10.8.2.2 to store mysql configuration (+ alternative DB)
(*) Built using eclipse helios SR2 win32 (using indigo caused some build exceptions)
(*) Added mysql database installer (/wavsep-install/install.jsp)
(*) Fixed various documentation flaws.
(*) Started to use action-less form tags in new test cases (no change for legacy) - less to maintain (10x to the zap-wave project).   
(*) All the in-directory index pages were updated to generate it for GET/POST.
(*) Converted zap-wave test cases into wavsep/mysql format, released under GPL 3.0 
    (GPL 3.0 is compatible with ASF 2.0 according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License)
 
    The entire /passive/ zap-wave directory was left nearly intact, except titles, license and minor changes:
    session-password-autocomplete.jsp, weak-authentication-basic.jsp, 
    
    The test cases in the /active/ zap-wave directory had undergone some changes: 
    xss-url-basic.jsp -> equivalent to the test case Case1-Tag2HtmlPageScope.jsp (RXSS-GET)
    xss-form-basic.jsp -> equivalent to the test case Case1-Tag2HtmlPageScope.jsp (RXSS-POST)
    xss-url-strip-script.jsp -> updated & converted to Case1-Tag2HtmlPageScope-StripScriptTag.jsp (RXSS-GET-Experimental)
    xss-form-strip-script.jsp -> updated & converted to Case1-Tag2HtmlPageScope-StripScriptTag.jsp (RXSS-POST-Experimental)
    xss-basic-cookie.jsp -> converted & altered to Case1-Tag2HtmlPageScope.jsp under RXSS-COOKIE-Experimental
    	(format changed: cookie generated in index page or the page itself, not directly from input in the current page,
    	 might require configuration changes to work)
    xss-form-url.jsp -> converted, altered & duplicated into the following test cases:
      Case2-Tag2HtmlPageScope-SecretVectorPOST.jsp (RXSS-GET-Experimental)
      Case2-Tag2HtmlPageScope-SecretVectorGET.jsp (RXSS-POST-Experimental)
      //partially equivalent to the test case Case1-Tag2HtmlPageScope.jsp,
      //but is only vulnerable in a secret input vector, which I did not cover properly
    xss-form-anti-csrf.jsp -> converted, altered & duplicated into the following test cases:
      Case3-Tag2HtmlPageScope-ConstantAntiCSRFToken.jsp (GET & POST test cases)
      Case4-Tag2HtmlPageScope-ChangingAntiCSRFToken.jsp (GET & POST test cases)
      //Although this case is similar to case32, the anticsrf token here is truly random
      //so it was added as another test case. 
      //Two versions of the token were implemented (in 4 test cases): 
      //(1)The first token value is generated randomly but then remains unchanged,  
      // so that it won't affect all scans. All of wavsep index pages were updated to support it. 
      //(2)The second token value is generated randomly in each access to the page.
        
    inject-sql-url-basic.jsp -> converted to the experimental sqli GET test case
    	Case1-InjectionInInsertValues-String-BinaryDeliberateRuntimeError-With200Errors.jsp
    inject-sql-form-basic.jsp  -> converted to the experimental sqli POST test case
    	Case1-InjectionInInsertValues-String-BinaryDeliberateRuntimeError-With200Errors.jsp
    		
       //Explanation: I have been avoiding the implementation of insert/delete statement
       //Since I didn't want to overflow the database, but connection temporary tables
       //solved this issue. Detection might be identical for most cases, but verification 
       //and exploitation will only be identical using deliberate runtime errors.

= version 1.0.3 =
=================
(*) Root problem solved.

=================
= version 1.0.2 =
=================
(*) Database connection methods are now implemented in
	a single class, to make future development easier.
(*) Implemented the usage of a database connection pool (DBCP 1.4),
    to enhance WAVSEP's ability to handle stress, and thus, 
    help scanners to avoid inconsistent results.
    As of this version, WAVSEP requires JDK 1.6 (run/compile),
    since DBCP 1.4 runs on JDK 1.6 only (JDBC 4).
(*) Implemented console error reporting in the case of DB connection failures. 

=================
= version 1.0.1 =
=================
-- Minor Changes --
(*) Replaced the VBScript function "MsgBox" with "Document.Write" in 
    test cases 13,14,15,20,21,25,26 and 29 (16 cases total)
    of RXSS-GET & RXSS-POST to avoid the VBScript pop up bug
    in Netsparker (or scanners with similar repeating VBScript pop-up issues).
